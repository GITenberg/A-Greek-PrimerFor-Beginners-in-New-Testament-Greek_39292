<p>A scholarly knowledge of Greek requires some time and effort. Every preacher and teacher of the New Testament books would be greatly helped by being able even to refer to the dictionary and to pick out the critical notes in a high-grade commentary.</p>
<p>In many instances memory has grown dim, and there is need of some not too pretentious guide to a new beginning.</p>
<p>Out of many such experiences this meager outline has come, an attempt built up on the old maxim, "Do not in the beginning attempt too much."</p>

<hr />

<h2>SUGGESTIONS</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Learn principles. Language preceded grammar, and the latter is at best a generalization of the former.</li>
	<li>Learn words. Acquire a vocabulary. The first step is to know words and, further, to know them in their Greek dress.</li>
	<li>Read aloud.  The ear lends efficient help to the eye. There is an indefinable swing even to Greek prose that facilitates study.</li>
	<li>Commit passages&mdash;however brief&mdash;to memory. Better than rules is a fund of actual examples, stored up in the memory, of Greek as it was spoken and written.</li>
	<li>With this outline the text of the forth Gospel should be used from the start (see notice on next page) for study, reading aloud, and for memorizing.</li>
	<li>Remember that in the end all methods avail little. The way to do a thing is to do it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>SYLLABLES</h3>

<p>1. There are as many syllables in a word as there are separate vowels and diphthongs.</p>

<p>2. Consonants are pronounced with succeeding vowels: λό-γος, πο-λί-της, ἐ-λέ-γε-το.  Where two consonants occur together, they are not separated at the beginning of a word or in the case of combinations that do occur at the beginning of the words. G. 97; H.A. 91.</p>

<h2>II. ACCENT</h2>

<p>Accent occurs on one of the last three syllables, and represents to the eye the movement of the voice in pronouncing words. Its practical value is to indicate the stress of the voice in reading.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Note 1.</b></span>&mdash;Accent forms are three (acute &acute;, grave `, and circumflex &circ;) and may be summarized thus:</p>

<table align="center" cellspacing="3">
<tr>
	<td><i>Short ultima</i></td>
	<td><img src="images/left-brace.png" alt="left-brace image" width="12" height="84" /></td>
	<td>antepenult &acute;<br />short penult &acute;<br />long penult &circ;<br />ultima &acute;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><i>Long ultima</i></td>
	<td><img src="images/left-brace.png" alt="left-brace image"  width="12" height="54" /></td>
	<td>penult &acute;<br />ultima &acute; or `</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p><span class="smcap"><b>Note 2.</b></span>&mdash;In composition acute accent on the last syllable becomes grave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Note 3.</b></span>&mdash;Accent is often arbitrary. Rules indicate where accent <i>may</i> (not <i>must</i>) occur.</p>

<h2>III. BREATHINGS</h2>

<p>Words beginning with a vowel are pronounced with or without aspiration (initial "h"). Aspiration is indicated by the sign ( ῾ ), ὅτι (hoti). Unaspirated syllables are marked ( ᾿ ), οὐκ (ook). </p>

<p>American him is ῾im; horse is ῾orse.</p>

<p>English im is ᾿im; orse is ᾿orse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Note 1.</b></span>&mdash;Breathing stands over the vowel: in a diphthong, over the second vowel (accent also stands over the second vowel, and precedes the breathing). Bt. 8; Gl. 6; Gn. 11.</p>

<p>Note may be made of the marks of punctuation: comma (,), color (&middot;), interrogation (;), period (.).</p>

<h2>IV. DECLENSIONS</h2>

<p>1. There are three numbers; singular, dual, and plural. In late Greek the dual is less frequent and except the numeral δύο, does not occur in the New Testament.  Bt. 74; Gl. 57; Gn. 155; H.A. 123.</p>

<p>2. The five cases are the nominative, genitive (equals of, or a possessive), dative (equals to, for, with), accusative (equals English objective), vocative (as in direct address). Bt 74; Gl. 59; Gn. 160; H.A. 123.</p>

<h2>V. THE VERB: CONJUGATION</h2>

<p>1. In the study of the verb four points are to be considered: stem; tense-signs; theme vowels (short in indicative, imperative, infinitive, and participial modes; long in the subjunctive and merged in a diphthong in the optative); and personal endings.</p>

<p>2. The stem is the basic part of the inflected word. To this are appending the various signs, as above, which in verb analysis must again be cut off.  E. g., τι-μά-ω, I honor, stem τῑμᾰ.  Bt. 157-61; Gl. 248; Gn. 404-7, 153; H.A. 153.</p>

<p>3. The tenses of the verb are called primary or secondary as they have to do with present (or future) or past time.  Taking the verb λύω as a model we have:</p>

<table width="90%" border="0" align="center">
<tr>
	<td align="center">Primary</td>
	<td align="center">Secondary</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Present, stem λυ-</td>
	<td>Imperfect, stem ἐ-λυ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Future, stem λυσ-</td>
	<td>Aorist, stem ἐ-λυς</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Perfect, stem λε-λυκ-</td>
	<td>Pluperfect, stem ἐ-λε-λυκ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td colspan="2">Future perfect, stem λε-λυσ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td colspan="2">Bt. 162; Gl. 311; Gn. 717; H.A. 372.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>4. The future tenses (future, future perfect) are indicated by a σ(+ ο/ε) appended to the stem, as λύ-ω, λύ-<u>σ</u>ω, λε-λύ-<u>σ</u>-ο-μαι, λύ-θή-<u>σ</u>-ο-μαι. Bt. 212; Gn. 662; Gl. 277; H.A. 372.</p>

<p>5. The perfect tenses (perfect, future perfect, pluperfect) are indicated by (1) the doubling of the stem (i. e., repeating the initial consonant with ε&mdash;), and (2) in the active voice by an affixed &mdash;κ&mdash; (cf. Latin &mdash;v&mdash;). E. g., λύ-ω perf. λέ-λυ-κα (for λύ-λυ-κα).</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Note 1.</b></span>&mdash;If the verb begins with a middle or rough mute, the reduplication occurs with the corresponding smooth mute (cf. I,3). E. g., πέ-φυ-κα (for φέ-φυ-κα).  Bt. 162; Gl. 287; Gn. 455; H.A. 300-3.</p>

<p>6.  Secondary tenses are indicated generally be the prefix ἐ&mdash;, e.g., ἔ-λυ-ο-ν, ἐ-λε-λύ-κ-ε-μεν. In case the verb itself begins with a vowel, the initial vowel is lengthened. E.g., ἀ-κού-ω, ἤ-κου-ο-ν. Bt. 171-2; Gl. 264, 293; Gn. 465, 3; H.A. 354-7.</p>

<p>7. The theme vowel immediately follows the stem. In the indicative it is &mdash;ο&mdash; before μ and ν, otherwise &mdash;ε&mdash;; in the subjunctive, &mdash;ω&mdash;or &mdash;η&mdash;; in the optative (mode vowel), &mdash;οι&mdash; or &mdash;αι&mdash; (aorist passive indicative, &mdash;ει&mdash;). E. g., ἔ-λυ-ο-ν, ἕ-λυ-ε-ς, λύ-ω-μαι, λύ-η-ται, λυ-οί-μην, λυ-σαί-μην. Bt. 159-60; Gl. 294-5; Gn. 568, 719, 730; H.A. 372.</p>

<p class="note">(1) In aorist tenses except second aorist and aorist passive, the theme vowel is &mdash;α&mdash;.</p>
<p class="note">(2) In the perfect active the them vowel is &mdash;α&mdash;, in the pluperfect active it is &mdash;ε&mdash;.</p>
<p class="note">(3) In the pluperfect middle and passive the theme vowel is omitted. E. g., λε-λύ-σ-α-μεν, λε-λύ-κ-α-τε, ἐ-λε-λύ-κ-ε-μεν, λέ-λυ-μαι, ἐ-λε-λύ-μην. Bt. 201, 222-4; Gl. 279, 288-9, 298; Gn. 669, 682-3, 698; H.A. 428, 446, 459, 461-3.</p>

<p>8. The sign of the passive voice is often &mdash;θε&mdash;, sometimes lengthened to &mdash;θη&mdash; in conjugation, e. g., λυ-θή-σ-ο-μαι. Bt. 231-2; Gl. 302; Gn. 707; H.A. 468.</p>

<p>9. The person of the verb is indicated by a letter or syllable (in origin a personal pronoun) added to end of verb. E. g., λύ-ο-μαι, ἔ-λυ-ο-ν.</p>

<p>10. The middle and passive voices are alike except in two tenses, the future and the aorist. Bt. 167; Gl. 263; Gn. 552; H.A. 376-80.</p>

<p>11. There are two sets (or double sets) of personal ending; one set for the active (primary and secondary) tenses, and one for the tenses of the middle and passive (except second aorist and aorist passive). Bt. 166; Gl. 263, 271; Gn. 551-3; H.A. 375.</p>

<p class="note">(1) The longer, softer endings generally indicate middle or passive voice.</p>

<p class="note">(2) In verbs as in noun the dual is less frequent in later Greek.</p>

<p>13. The endings of the active participle to indicate gender are respectively &mdash;ων, &mdash;ουσα, &mdash;ον. The form &mdash;ουσα is of the first declension; the others (&mdash;οντ, Gn. 25; Gl. 119) are of the third.</p>

<p>14.  Middle participles are of the first and second declensions and may be recognized by the syllable &mdash;μεν&mdash;. E. g., λυ-ό-μεν-ος.</p>

<p>15. The active infinitive regularly ends in &mdash;ειν &mdash;εν + theme vowel &mdash;ε&mdash;, contracted, &mdash;ειν). E. g., λύ-ειν (for λυ-ε-εν). The passive and middle (i.e., when used as passive) infinitives regularly end in &mdash;σθαι.  E. g., λύ-ε-σθαι, λύ-σ-α-σθαι.  The aorist passive infinitive ends in &mdash;ναι. E. g., λυ-θῆ-ναι. Bt. 167; Gl. 162, 273, 275; Gn. 301, 334.</p>

<p>17. The principal parts of the verb (which should be memorized) are the first person singular of the active indicative present, future, first aorist, and perfect; the middle perfect; and the passive aorist. Bt 162-3; Gl. 311; Gn. 462-5; H.A. 304c.</p>

<p>18. A small class of verbs (about equal to the number of irregular verbs in English) retain the more primitive personal endings (e.g., act. ind. pres. sing., &mdash;μι, &mdash;σι, &mdash;τι, remains of old pronominal forms). Of such are τί-θη-μι, δί-δω-μι, ἴ-στη-μι. Bt. 251-8; Gl. 372-4; Gn. 500-509; H.A. 476-92.</p>

<p>19. Certain verbs with vowel stems, as τιμά-ω, φιλέ-ω, δηλό-ω, by contraction with initial vowels in the personal endings assume forms not found in the regular verb paradigms. E. g., τιμά-εις, τίμᾶς; ἐ-τίμα-ε, ἐτίμα; ἐ-τίμα-ο-ν, ἐ-τίμων. Bt. 248-50; Gl. 313-15; Gn. 492-94; H.A. 337-41. For changes in accent see: Bt. 65; Gl. 29, Gn. 117; H.A. 37-39.</p>

<p class="note">(1) These forms are best studied as they occur by reference to the grammars.</p>

<h2>VI. SEQUENCE</h2>

<p>1. It is a principle in Greek, as in other languages, that a certain relation must hold between the verbs of dependent clauses and those of the independent clauses on which they are based.</p>

<p>2. In Latin the sequence is one of tenses, primary tenses depending on primary tenses and secondary tenses on secondary tenses. But in Greek the tenses of the dependent modes do not, in general, express distinctions of time. G. M. T. 785, 20.</p>

<p>3. In Greek the subjunctive in dependent clauses is treated (usually) as though it were a <i>primary</i> mode: the optative as though it were a <i>secondary</i> mode. E. g.:</p>

<table align="center" width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
	<td align="center">τοῦτο πράττει ἵνα καλῶς ἔχη</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">τοῦτο ἔπραττε ἵνα καλῶς ἔχοι</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">But in the Greek of the New Testament. (B. M. T. 174, 259, 344) and in Latin (Hale and Buck's Latin Grammar, 459) there is not optative in use, and the above distinction in modes no longer exits. Bt. 517, 2; Gl. 662; Gn. 448, 1249, 1267; H.A. 876. The trend of sequence is from the primary tenses of the indicative through subjunctive and optative in that order to the past tenses of the indicative. See under VII.</p>

<h2>VII. THE CONDITIONAL SENTENCE</h2>

<p>1. A conditional sentence is one that assumes what may or may not be true (in reality), and bases on it some other statement (i. e., the supposition is assumed to be true). Bt. 600-1; Gl. 645; Gn. 1381; H.A. 889.</p>

<p>2. A simple supposition implying nothing as to fulfillment, has the indicative (or an equivalent; Bt. 602, notes) in both clauses.</p>

<p class="note">(1) If a specific sequence is made in present time, then the present indicative stands in both clauses.  If in past time, a past indicative occurs in both clauses. E. g.:</p>

<table align="center" width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
	<td align="center">Present: εἰ τοῦτο πράττει, καλῶς ἔχει</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">Past: εἰ τοῦτο ἔπραττε, καλῶς εἶχε</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Note 1.</b></span>&mdash;The same tense need not necessarily stand in both clauses, e. g., εἰ τοῦτο ἔπραττε, καλῶς ἔχει.</p>

<p class="note">(2) A general reference if in present time, expressing a customary or repeated action or a general truth, has ἐάν with the subjunctive in the if-clause and in the conclusion the present indicative or some form denoting present repetition, e. g., ἐὰν τοὺτο ποιῇ, καλῶς ἔχει. If the supposition is in the past time, the if-clause will have the optative with εἰ and in the conclusion will stand the imperfect indicative or some form denoting past repetition, e. g., εἰ τοῦτο πράττοι, καλῶς εἶχε. Bt. 608-10; Gl. 651; Gn. 1393; H.A. 890, 892-4.</p>

<p>3. The supposition may imply something as to the likelihood of fulfillment.</p>

<p class="note">(1) If fulfillment is likely (and such contingencies are related to future time), then the if-clause will have ἐάν with the subjunctive and a future indicative (or an equivalent) will stand in the conclusion. This form is styled "future vivid." E. g., ἐὰν τοῦτο πράττῃ, καλῶς ἕξοι. If fulfillment is less than likely ("future less vivid"), εἰ with the optative will stand in the if-clause, the optative with ἄν (potential optative) in the conclusion.  E. g., εἰ τοῦτο πράττοι καλῶς ἄν ἔχοι. Bt. 604-5; Gl. 650-1; Gn. 1403.</p>

<p class="note">(2) A supposition contrary to fact has in the if-clause εἰ with a past indicative; in the conclusion, a past indicative with ἄν (potential indicative). E. g., εἰ τοῦτο ἔπραττε, καλῶς ἄν εἶχε. Bt. 606; Gl. 649; Gn. 13197; H.A. 895.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Note 1.</b></span>&mdash;For summary of conditional sentences, see Bt. 611; Gl 645; Gn. 1387; H.A. 891.</p>

<h2>VIII. FINAL CLAUSES</h2>

<p>1. Pure final clauses (expressing purpose or motive) take the subjunctive when dependent on primary tenses, the optative when dependent on secondary tenses.  The conjunction is ἵνα, ὡς, or ὅπως.  E. g., </p>

<table align="center" width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
	<td align="center">τοῦτο πράττει ἵνα καλῶς ἔχῃ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">τοῦτο ἔπραττε ἵνα καλῶς ἔχοι</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">Bt. 590; Gl. 640; Gn. 365; H.A. 881.</p>

<p>2. Object clauses dependent on verbs denoting care, attention or effort, regularly take the future indicative ὅπως, though the future optative is possible when dependent on a secondary tense. E. g.,</p>

<table align="center" width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
	<td align="center">φροντίζει ὅπως καλῶς ἕξει,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">ἐφρόντιζεν ὅπας καλῶς ἕζει<br />(or ἕζοι, see note).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">Bt. 593; Gn. 1372; H.A. 885.</p>

<p>3. Subordinate clauses introduced by μή (trans. <i>lest</i> or <i>that</i>), and dependent on verbs denoting fear, caution or danger, take the subjunctive when dependent on primary tenses, the optative when dependent on secondary tenses. E. g.,</p>

<table align="center" width="50%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
	<td align="center">φοβεῖται μὴ τοῦτο πράττωμεν</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">ἐφοβεῖτο μὴ τοῦτο πράττοιμεν<br />(or πράττωμεν, see note).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">Bt. 593; Gl. 610; Gn. 1378.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Note 1.</b></span>&mdash;In rules 1-3, for greater vividness&mdash;as though using the language of the person who conceived the purpose&mdash;the subjunctive may be used even when dependent on a secondary tense (see examples above). Gl. 638; Gn. 1372.</p>

<h2>IX. INDIRECT DISCOURSE</h2>

<p>1. A statement or question of a speaker or writer may be quoted directly, i. e., without change in the form of the language. E. g.:</p>

<table align="center" width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
	<td align="left">Direct: </td>
	<td align="center">τοῦτο πράξω</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="left" valign="top">Indirect: </td>
	<td align="center" valign="top">λέγει<br />or<br />ἔλεγε</td>
	<td align="center" width="18" height="64"><img src="images/left-brace.png" alt="left-brace image" width="12" height="64" /></td>
	<td align="center">ὅτι τοῦτο πράξει.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">Bt. 668; Gl. 623; Gn. 1475.</p>

<p>2. Or it may be a change to adapt it to the form of the sentence of which it becomes a part. The form of change will depend on the introductory verb of saying, φημί, λέγω, or εἶπον.</p>

<p class="note">(1) If φημί, the main verb of the quotation will be changed to the infinitive mode of the same tense and voice. E. g.,</p>

<table align="center" width="70%" border="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
	<td align="left">Direct: </td>
	<td align="center">τοῦτο πράττω</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="left" valign="top">Indirect: </td>
	<td align="center" valign="top">φησί<br />or<br />ἔφη</td>
	<td align="center" width="18" height="64"><img src="images/left-brace.png" alt="left-brace image" width="12" height="64" /></td>
	<td align="center">τούτο πράττειν.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="note">(2) If λέγω with ὅτι or ὡς, no change will occur when dependent on a primary tense. When dependent on a secondary tense, indicatives and subjunctives <i>may</i> (not <i>must</i>) be changed to corresponding tenses (and voice) of the optative; optatives will remain unchanged. E. g.:</p>

<table align="center" width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
	<td align="left">Direct: </td>
	<td align="left" colspan="3">τοῦτο πράξω</td>
</tr>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
